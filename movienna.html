        <h2>01 Project Overview</h2>
        <h3>Role</h3>
        <p>User Research, Interaction, Visual Design, Prototyping and Testing</p>
        <h3>Project duration</h3>
        <p>May - October 2022</p>
        <h3>The product</h3>
        <p>As part of the Google UX Design course I designed a movie theater app,
            which makes reserving and purchasing tickets an easy thing to do, when on the go.</p>
        <h3>The problem</h3>
        <p>Users prefer to have their movie tickets all in one app, rather than having it only send to their email
            address.
            Further, they find unnecessary information overwhelming and prefer simple designs.</p>
        <h3>The goal</h3>
        <p>Creating an easy-to-use app, which gathers all the purchased tickets in one place.
            Focusing on a clear design with only necessary features and information, so it does not overwhelm the user.
        </p>
        <h2>02 Understanding the user</h2>
        <p>I conducted online interviews and created empathy maps to have an overview of the users needs and
            frustrations.
            A primary user group identified through research were young adults in their mid 20s, who like to book their
            movie theater tickets and seats online and in advance.
            <br><br>
            Before conducting the interviews I did a S.W.C.D.UX.O. analysis of common cinema apps used in my hometown.
            The primary user group confirmed my initial assumption about the most popular app used in this area.
            The app is not as modern as it could be and the interface has problems regularly.
            Other user problems are that they do not want too much information, when using apps in general.
        </p>
        <h3>Pain Points</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Responsive</b><br>
                When clicking on the seat map it should let you pick the seats you wanted to pick and not jump around
            </li>
            <li><b>Convenient</b><br>
                When booking tickets it would be the best if everything is available in the app and not just sent by
                email
            </li>
            <li><b>Outdated</b><br>
                Apps should have a more modern and responsive interface nowadays</li>
            <li><b>Simplicity</b><br>
                The offered elements should not be overwhelming as long as you can do the basic things with the app</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Persona: Debbie</h3>
        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
        <p>Debbie is a busy fashion student who needs her movie theater tickets directly in an app because she does not
            want
            to browse through all her mails to find her tickets.</p>

        <h3>Persona: Evelin</h3>
        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
        <p>Evelin is a retiree from Germany who needs an easy to understand app because she doesn't like to be
            overwhelmed
            with informations.</p>
