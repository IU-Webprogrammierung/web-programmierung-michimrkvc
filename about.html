                    <p>Hi! I am Michi, a UX designer who is all about creating intuitive, inclusive, and human-centered
                        experiences.</p>

                    <p>I am currently studying UX Design and constantly expanding my skills—especially when it comes to
                        accessibility, which is a big focus for me right now.
                        I want to make sure the things I design work for everyone, not just the average user.</p>

                    <p>I am super curious by nature, and I love digging into what people need, testing ideas, and
                        finding
                        simple, thoughtful solutions. Whether it is wireframes, user flows, or high-fidelity prototypes,
                        I
                        try to design with empathy and intention. With a strong foundation in user research and
                        interaction
                        design, I focus on crafting interfaces that are both visually appealing and highly functional.
                    </p>

                    <p>Besides design, one of my biggest passions is dancing—mainly hip hop and house.
                        For me, dance is about freedom, expression, and connecting with people.</p>

                    <p>Right now, I am exploring HTML and CSS to get a better understanding of frontend development,
                        working on app prototypes, and learning as much as I can about accessible, responsible design.
                        Always open to new ideas, challenges, and collaborations.</p>

                    <p>Let's build things that not only work—but feel good to use.</p>
