    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>As a UX designer, I am dedicated to creating intuitive and accessible digital experiences.
        With a strong foundation in user research and interaction design,
        I focus on crafting interfaces that are both visually appealing and highly functional.
        While I am currently expanding my skills in HTML and CSS to better understand front-end implementation,
        my primary goal is to ensure inclusivity and accessibility in every design.
        I believe that great UX goes beyond aestheticsâ€”it should empower all users to navigate and interact
        effortlessly.</p>
