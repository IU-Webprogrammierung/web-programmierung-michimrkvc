    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>As a UX designer, I am dedicated to creating intuitive and accessible digital experiences. 
        With a strong foundation in user research and interaction design, 
        I focus on crafting interfaces that are both visually appealing and highly functional. 
        While I am currently expanding my skills in HTML and CSS to better understand front-end implementation, 
        my primary goal is to ensure inclusivity and accessibility in every design. 
        I believe that great UX goes beyond aestheticsâ€”it should empower all users to navigate and interact effortlessly.</p>
